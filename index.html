    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base
    it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4> Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>

    <p class="special">Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things we
    have to do first. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the
    base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and
    cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start 
    out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly.
    You can have everything you need to make many different pizzas
    using the same base structure that is et up beforehand. </p>

    <h5 class="special">This is how you make a pizza</h5>
    <p><small>There are some specific steps you needs to take to make a pizza,
    we will list them here.</small></p>

<ul>
    <li class="fave">pepperoni</li>
    <li>olives</li>
    <li>peppers <em>(never green)</em></li>
    <li> mushrooms</li>
